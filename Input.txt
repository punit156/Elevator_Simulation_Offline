/* For the sake of keeping it simple I've assumed that an elevator's capacity is 4 and not 10. 
I did this because I wanted to present some corner cases and at the same time, didn't want to increase the size of 
input file. You'll get to know once you see the inputs */

/* I've assumed 3 elevators A,B and C. It's easier to explain with alphabets, but originally they would have ID's */

/*Also please note that the comments are just for your understanding. Original input file will not have the comments */

/* The only difference in this one is the arrival time of last passenger */
